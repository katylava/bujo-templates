I have a really hard time setting up new month pages in my "bullet journal" (in
quotes because I don't really do it "right") by hand. I created this project so
I could just print out the pages and tape them into my journal, instead of not
journalling for a few days at the beginning of each month.


Setup:

- Clone repo and cd into it
- `npm install`

Generate:

- `npm run build`

Print:

- `npm run serve`
- Go to http://127.0.0.1:8080 in your browser
- Click on the module you want to print
- Print
